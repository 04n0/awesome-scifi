# Awesome Sci-Fi

> Sci-Fi worth consuming

I [asked on Twitter](https://twitter.com/sindresorhus/status/557586610850897920) for recommendations as I want to get into reading Sci-Fi novels. The below is the result. Thanks everyone for recommending your favorites! :)

Personally I'm going to start with the first three.
